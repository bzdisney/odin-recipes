        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bread -</strong> a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
            <li><strong>Butter -</strong> use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese -</strong> we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Butter the toast -</strong> spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Heat skillet -</strong> place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. Add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side down.</li>
            <li><strong>Add cheese -</strong> stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown the toast -</strong> continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
