        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you can't make this, give up.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Toaster -</strong> use the one you have. Don't have one? Ask your mom.</li>
            <li><strong>Plate -</strong> unless you just like holding hot tarts.</li>
            <li><strong>Poptarts -</strong>  I won't tell you what kind to get, but if you choose certain flavors you'll probably lose friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Cup -</strong> it's for milk</li>
            <li><strong>Milk -</strong> it's for the cup. And tarts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Put Poptarts in Toaster -</strong>  You want these fools hot but not burnt.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Poptarts out of Toaster -</strong> Wouldn't make much sense to leave them in the toaster.</li>
            <li><strong>Place Poptarts on Plate -</strong> or hold them in your hand you peasant.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour Milk into Cup -</strong> pouring milk on the table won't keep the milk together.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve -</strong> Dip that steamy rectangle into your milk, then bite it. It's better this way.</li>
        </ol>
